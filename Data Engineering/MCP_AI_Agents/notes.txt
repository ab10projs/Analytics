1------------- MCP basics  (Model context Protocol)--------------------------1
-- Anthrop\c this the company that introduced this MCP concept
-- It is only useful if many people use MCP
-- LLM an only generate text, summarize text, generate code, translate text etc... LLM calls tools for specific tasks that LLM can not do (like API to generate image, . 
-- most of the time LLM makes http request to other tools for specilized tasks.
-- LLM can call other LLMs
-- With MPC we can combile tools with LLMs
-- MCP is just like USB port, as USB prot can allow connection of other hardware to PC 
-- LLM <---MCP--> {Tools, LLMs, prompts} 

-- With MCP, there is always a host (e.g. Claude/Cursor/Lovable/Winsurf). This host needs to have a client, which is automatically included in this host. This client can communicate with APIs, resources and prompt templates. MCP server is the layer of abstraction between client and resources/prompts etc. So MCP connects with APIs, Resources and prompt templates.
-- LLM AI app can talk to different tools via MCP 
-- MCPs and APIs have lot of similarities 
	similarties
		-- both client server Model
		-- Abstraction
		-- Simplify integration
	differences
		-- purpose build vs general purpose
		-- Dynamic Self discovery
		-- Standardization of Interface

-- MCP is just like a WRAPPER around API

-- node.js on local machine , because most of the servers work with npx command and npx command runs via node.js
-- install nvm to upgrade or downgrade versions 
-- claude desktop , as this is the first host. 
-- vs code, as with vscode we can edit claude config files
-- UV, python , pyenv virtual env
