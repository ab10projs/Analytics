# **Data Description for Concrete Strength Dataset**

## **Objective**
The dataset aims to predict the **Concrete Strength** based on various material compositions and curing age.

## **Features and Descriptions**
| Column Name             | Data Type | Description |
|-------------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Cement**              | float    | Amount of cement in kg/m³ used in the concrete mix. |
| **Blast_Furnance_Slag** | float    | Amount of blast furnace slag (a by-product of steel production) in kg/m³. |
| **Fly_Ash**             | float    | Amount of fly ash (a by-product of coal combustion) in kg/m³. |
| **Water**               | float    | Amount of water in kg/m³ used in the mix. |
| **Superplasticizer**    | float    | Amount of superplasticizer (chemical admixture to improve workability) in kg/m³. |
| **Coarse_Aggregate**    | float    | Amount of coarse aggregate (gravel/stones) in kg/m³. |
| **Fine_Aggregate**      | float    | Amount of fine aggregate (sand) in kg/m³. |
| **Age_Day**             | int      | Age of concrete in **days** (time for curing). |
| **Concrete_Strength**   | float    | **Target Variable** – Compressive strength of concrete in MPa. |
